# System Design Notes

Welcome to my curated collection of system design notes! This repository is created to help engineers, developers, and learners understand complex system design concepts through clear explanations and visual diagrams.

Whether you're preparing for system design interviews, brushing up your backend architecture knowledge, or building scalable systems in real lifeâ€”this repo aims to serve as a go-to reference.

## ðŸ§  Why I Created This

System design can feel overwhelming without the right guidance. I started collecting notes during my own prep and career, and decided to make them public to give back to the community. The goal is to make learning simple, visual, and practical.
